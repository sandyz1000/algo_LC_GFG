"""Count all possible walks from a source to a destination with exactly k edges

Given a directed graph and two vertices 'u' and 'v' in it, count all possible walks from 'u' to 'v'
with exactly k edges on the walk.

The graph is given as adjacency matrix representation where value of graph[i][j] as 1 indicates
that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j and a value 0 indicates no edge from i to j.

For example:
Consider the following graph. Let source 'u' be vertex 0, destination 'v' be 3 and k be 2.
The output should be 2 as there are two walk from 0 to 3 with exactly 2 edges.
The walks are {0, 2, 3} and {0, 1, 3}

    Discussion:

    The worst case time complexity of the above function is O(Vk) where V is the number of
    vertices in the given graph. We can simply analyze the time complexity by drawing recursion
    tree. The worst occurs for a complete graph. In worst case, every internal node of recursion
    tree would have exactly n children.

    We can optimize the above solution using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to build a 3D table
    where first dimension is source, second dimension is destination, third dimension is number
    of edges from source to destination, and the value is count of walks. Like other Dynamic
    Programming problems, we fill the 3D table in bottom up manner. """

    Time complexity of the above DP based solution is O(V3K) which is much better than the naive
    solution.
    We can also use Divide and Conquer to solve the above problem in O(V3Logk) time. The count of
    walks of length k from u to v is the [u][v]â€™th entry in (graph[V][V])k. We can calculate
    power of by doing O(Logk) multiplication by using the divide and conquer technique to
    calculate power. A multiplication between two matrices of size V x V takes O(V3) time.
    Therefore overall time complexity of this method is O(V3Logk). """
