Shuffle a given array

Given an array, write a program to generate a random permutation of array elements. This question
is also asked as "shuffle a deck of cards" or "randomize a given array".

--------------------------------
Explanation:
--------------------------------

Let the given array be arr[]. A simple solution is to create an auxiliary array temp[] which is
initially a copy of arr[]. Randomly select an element from temp[], copy the randomly selected
element to arr[0] and remove the selected element from temp[]. Repeat the same process n times
and keep copying elements to arr[1], arr[2], ... .
The time complexity of this solution will be O(n^2).

Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle Algorithm works in O(n) time complexity. The assumption here is, we are given
a function rand() that generates random number in O(1) time.
The idea is to start from the last element, swap it with a randomly selected element from the whole
array (including last). Now consider the array from 0 to n-2 (size reduced by 1), and repeat the
process till we hit the first element.

--------------------------------
Algorithm:
--------------------------------
To shuffle an array a of n elements (indices 0..n-1):
  for i from n - 1 downto 1 do
       j = random integer with 0 <= j <= i
       exchange a[j] and a[i]

import random


# Time Complexity: O(n), assuming that the function rand() takes O(1) time
def randomize(arr, n):
    """A function to generate a random permutation of arr[]"""
    # Start from the last element and swap one by one. We don't need to run for
    # the first element that's why i > 0
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        j = random.randint(0, i)  # Pick a random index from 0 to i
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]  # Swap arr[i] with the element at random index
    return arr


if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    n = len(arr)
    print(randomize(arr, n))
