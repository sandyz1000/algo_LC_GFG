"""Find the row with maximum number of 1s

Given a boolean 2D array, where each row is sorted. Find the row with the maximum number of 1s.

------------

    Method-1

    A simple method is to do a row wise traversal of the matrix, count the number of 1s in each row
    and compare the count with max. Finally, return the index of row with maximum 1s. The time
    complexity of this method is O(m*n) where m is number of rows and n is number of columns in
    matrix.
    We can do better. Since each row is sorted, we can use Binary Search to count of 1s in each row.
    We find the index of first instance of 1 in each row. The count of 1s will be equal to total
    number of columns minus the index of first 1.

    The main function that returns index of row with maximum number of 1s.
    Time Complexity: O(mLogn) where m is number of rows and n is number of columns in matrix.

    Instead of doing binary search in every row, we first check whether the row has more 1s than max
